# Delivery Route Optimization

Using Python and Operations Research techniques to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) for a logistics scenario in Bangkok.

## 🎯 Objective
To minimize total travel distance and optimize fleet utilization for last-mile delivery services using **Google OR-Tools**.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Core Logic)
- **Google OR-Tools** (Optimization Solver)
- **Folium** (Geospatial Visualization)
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)

## Key Results
- Minimized total distance for multiple delivery vehicles.
- Implemented **Load Balancing** to distribute workload evenly across the fleet.
- Visualized optimized routes on an interactive map.

## Visualization

*(Result of route optimization: Vehicle 0 covers the city center, while Vehicle 1 handles the eastern suburbs)*

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Install dependencies: `!pip install ortools folium`
3. Run all cells to see the optimization in action.
